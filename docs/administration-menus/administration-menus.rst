Administration Menus
====================

Administration Menus are the interfaces displayed in WordPress
Administration. They allow you to add option pages for your plugin.

      **Note:** For information on managing **Navigation Menus**, see
      the `Navigation
      Menus <https://developer.wordpress.org/theme/functionality/navigation-menus/>`__
      chapter of the `Theme Developer
      Handbook <https://developer.wordpress.org/theme/>`__.

Top-Level Menus and Sub-Menus
-----------------------------

The Top-level menus are rendered along the left side of the WordPress
Administration. Each menu may contain a set of Sub-menus.

When deciding between `Top-level
menus <https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/top-level-menus/>`__
and
`Sub-menus <https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/sub-menus/>`__
think carefully about the needs of your plugin as well as the needs of
your end users.

--------------

   **Alert:** We recommend developers with a single option page to add
   it as Sub-menu to one of the existing Top-level menus; such as
   *Settings* or *Tools*.
