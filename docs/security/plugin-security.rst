Plugin Security
===============

.. contents::

Congratulations, your code works! But is it safe? How will the plugin
protect your users if their site gets hacked? The best plugins in the
WordPress.org directory keep their users’ information safe.

Please keep in mind that your code may be running across hundreds,
perhaps even millions, of websites, so security is of the utmost
importance.

In this chapter we will cover how to :ref:`check user capabilities <checking-user-capabilities>`,
:ref:`validate <data-validation>` and :ref:`sanitize input <securing-input>`, :ref:`sanitize
output <securing-output>` and :ref:`create and validate nonces <nonces>`.
