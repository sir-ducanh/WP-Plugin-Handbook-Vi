Nonces

Nonces are generated numbers used to verify origin and intent of
requests for security purposes. Each nonce can only be used once.

If your plugin allows users to submit data; be it on the Admin or the
Public side; you have to make sure that the user is who they say they
are and that they `have the necessary
capability <https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/checking-user-capabilities/>`__
to perform the action. Doing both in tandem means that data is only
changing when the user *expects* it to be changing.

.. _header-n5:

Using Nonces
------------

Following our `checking user capabilities
example <https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/checking-user-capabilities/#restricted-to-a-specific-capability>`__,
the next step in user data submission security is using nonces.

The capability check ensures that only users who have permission to
delete a post are able to delete a post. But what if someone were to
trick you into clicking that link? You have the necessary capability, so
you could unwittingly delete a post.

Nonces can be used to check that the current user actually intends to
perform the action.

When you generate the delete link, you’ll want to use
`wp\ create\ nonce() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_create_nonce/>`__
function to add a nonce to the link, the argument passed to the function
ensures that the nonce being created is unique to that particular
action.

Then, when you’re processing a request to delete a link, you can check
that the nonce is what you expect it to be.
