Metadata
========

Metadata, by its very definition, is information about information. In
the case of WordPress, itâ€™s information associated with posts, users,
comments and terms.

An example would be a Content Type called Products with a metadata field
for price. This field would be stored in the ``postmeta`` table.

Given the many-to-one relationship of metadata in WordPress, your
options are fairly limitless. You can have as many meta options as you
wish, and you can store just about anything in there.

This chapter will discuss :ref:`managing post
metadata <managing-post-metadata>`, :ref:`creating custom meta
boxes <custom-meta-boxes/>`, and :ref:`rendering post metadata <rendering-post-metadata>`.
