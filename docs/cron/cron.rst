What is WP-Cron 
----------------

Cron is the time-based task scheduling system that is available on UNIX
systems. WP-Cron is how WordPress handles scheduling time-based tasks in
WordPress. Several WordPress core features, such as checking for updates
and publishing scheduled post, utilize WP-Cron.

WP-Cron works by: on every page load, a list of scheduled tasks is
checked to see what needs to be run. Any tasks scheduled to be run will
be run during that page load. WP-Cron does not run constantly as the
system cron does; it is only triggered on page load. Scheduling errors
could occur if you schedule a task for 2:00PM and no page loads occur
until 5:00PM.

Why use WP-Cron
---------------

Why use WP-Cron? Many hosting services are shared and do not provide
access to the system cron but WordPress core and many plugins do need a
cron system to perform time based tasks. Cron is a useful tool, thus the
beginnings of WP-Cron. Though it may not run at a specific time, WP-Cron
will get your tasks done in a timely manner. Using the WordPress API is
a simpler method to setting up cron tasks than going outside of
WordPress.

With a system cron if the time passes and the task did not run it is
lost and will never run. WP-Cron will run tasks regardless of how old
they are. Tasks will sit in a queue until a page is loaded to trigger
them, thus no task will ever be lost.
