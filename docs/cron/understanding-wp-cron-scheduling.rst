Understanding WP-Cron Scheduling
================================

Unlike a traditional system cron that schedules tasks for specific times
(i.e. every hour at 5 minutes past the hour), WP-Cron uses intervals to
simulate a system cron. WP-Cron is given the time for the first task and
an interval, the time in seconds, after which to repeat the task. For
example, if you schedule a task to begin at 2:00PM with an interval of
300 seconds (five minutes), the task would first run at 2:00PM and then
again at 2:05PM and every five minutes thereafter.

To simplify scheduling tasks, WordPress offers three default intervals
and an easy method for adding custom intervals.

The default intervals provided by WordPress are:

-  hourly

-  twicedaily

-  daily

To add a custom interval, you can create a filter, such as:

.. code:: php

   add_filter( 'cron_schedules', 'example_add_cron_interval' );
    
   function example_add_cron_interval( $schedules ) {
       $schedules['five_seconds'] = array(
           'interval' => 5,
           'display'  => esc_html__( 'Every Five Seconds' ),
       );
    
       return $schedules;
   }

This filter function creates a new interval that will allow us to run a
cron task every five seconds.

**Note:** All intervals are in seconds.
