Registering Custom Post Types
=============================

.. contents::

WordPress comes with five default post types:
``post, page, attachment, revision, menu``.

While developing your plugin, you may need to create your own specific
content type: for example, products for an e-commerce website,
assignments for an e-learning website, or movies for a review website.

Using Custom Post Types, you can **register your own post type**. Once a
post type is registered, it gets a new top-level administrative screen
that can be used to manage and create posts of that type.

To register a new post type, you use the
`register_post_type() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/>`__
function.

.. warning::

	 We recommend that you put custom post types in a plugin rather than a theme. This ensures that user content remains portable
   even if they change their theme.

The following example registers a new post type, Products, which is
identified in the database as ``wporg_product``.

.. code-block:: php

   function wporg_custom_post_type()
   {
       register_post_type('wporg_product',
                          array(
                              'labels'      => array(
                                  'name'          => __('Products'),
                                  'singular_name' => __('Product'),
                              ),
                              'public'      => true,
                              'has_archive' => true,
                          )
       );
   }
   add_action('init', 'wporg_custom_post_type');

Please visit the reference page of
`register_post_type() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/>`__
for the description of arguments.

.. warning::

	   You must call `register_post_type() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/>`__ before the ``admin_init`` and after the ``after_setup_theme``
     action hooks. A good hook to use is the ``init`` action hook.

Naming Best Practices
----------------------

It is important that you prefix your post type functions and identifiers
with a short prefix that corresponds to your plugin, theme, or website.

.. warning::

	     **To ensure forward compatibility**, do not use **wp_** as your identifier — it is being used by WordPress core.

       **Make sure your custom post type identifier does not exceed 20
       characters** as the ``post_type`` column in the database is
       currently a VARCHAR field of that length.

       If your identifier is too generic — for example: ``product``. It
       may conflict with other plugins or themes.

.. _header-n29:

URLs
-----

A custom post type gets its own slugs within the site URL structure.

A post of type ``wporg_product`` will use the following URL structure:
``http://example.com/wporg_product/%product_name%``.

``wporg_product`` is the slug of your custom post type and
``%product_name%`` is the slug of your particular product.

The final permalink would be:
``http://example.com/wporg_product/wporg-is-awesome``.

You can see the permalink on the edit screen for your custom post type,
just like with default post types.

.. _header-n35:

A Custom Slug for a Custom Post Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set a custom slug for the slug of your custom post type all you need
to do is add a key => value pair to the ``rewrite`` key in the
`register_post_type() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/>`__
arguments array.

Example:

.. code-block:: php

   function wporg_custom_post_type()
   {
       register_post_type('wporg_product',
                          array(
                              'labels'      => array(
                                  'name'          => __('Products'),
                                  'singular_name' => __('Product'),
                              ),
                              'public'      => true,
                              'has_archive' => true,
                              'rewrite'     => array( 'slug' => 'products' ), // my custom slug
                          )
       );
   }
   add_action('init', 'wporg_custom_post_type');

The above will result in the following URL structure:
``http://example.com/products/%product_name%``

.. warning::

	     Using a generic slug like ``products`` can potentially conflict with other plugins or themes.



.. note::

      Unlike the custom post type identifiers, the duplicate slug
      problem can be solved easily by changing the slug for one of the
      conflicting post types.

      If the plugin author was smart enough to include an
      `apply_filters() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/apply_filters/>`__
      call on the arguments, this can be done programmatically by
      overriding the arguments submitted via the
      `register_post_type() <https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/>`__
      function.

      **Solving duplicate post type identifiers is not possible without
      disabling one of the conflicting post types.**
