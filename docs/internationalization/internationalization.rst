What is Internationalization?
-----------------------------

Internationalization is the process of developing a plugin, so it can
easily be translated into other languages. Internationalization is often
abbreviated as ``i18n`` (because there are 18 letters between the
letters i and n).

Why is Internationalization Important? 
---------------------------------------

WordPress is used all over the world, in countries where English is not
the main language. The strings in the WordPress plugins need to be coded
in a special way so that can be easily translated into other languages.
As a developer, you may not be able to provide localizations for all
your users; however, a translator can successfully localize the theme
without needing to modify the source code itself.
