What is a Plugin?
=================

Plugins are packages of code that extend the core functionality of
WordPress. WordPress plugins are made up of PHP code and other assets
such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.

By making your own plugin you are *extending* WordPress, i.e. building
additional functionality on top of what WordPress already offers. For
example, you could write a plugin that displays links to the ten most
recent posts on your site.

Or, using WordPressâ€™ custom post types, you could write a plugin that
creates a full-featured support ticketing system with email
notifications, custom ticket statuses, and a client-facing portal. The
possibilities are *endless*!

Most WordPress plugins are composed of many files, but a plugin really
only *needs* one main file with a specifically formatted
`DocBlock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc#DocBlock>`__ in the
header.

`Hello Dolly <https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/>`__, one of the
first plugins, is only `82
lines <https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hello-dolly/trunk/hello.php>`__
long. Hello Dolly shows lyrics from `the famous
song <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Dolly!_(song)>`__ in the
WordPress admin. Some CSS is used in the PHP file to control how the
lyric is styled.

As a WordPress.org plugin author, you have an amazing opportunity to
create a plugin that will be installed, tinkered with, and loved by
millions of WordPress users. All **you** need to do is turn your great
idea into code. The Plugin Handbook is here to help you with that.
