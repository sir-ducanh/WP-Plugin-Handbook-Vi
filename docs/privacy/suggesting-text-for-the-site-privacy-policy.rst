Suggesting text for the site privacy policy
===========================================

Every plugin that collects, uses, or stores user data, or passes it to
an external source or third party, should add a section of suggested
text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with
``wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )``. This
will allow site administrators to pull that information into their
siteâ€™s privacy policy.

To make this simpler for the users, the text should address the
questions provided in the default privacy policy:

-  What personal data we collect and why we collect it

   -  Their own manually input information

   -  WP: Contact forms

   -  WP: Comments

   -  WP: Cookies

   -  WP: Third party embeds

   -  Analytics

-  Who we share your data with

-  How long we retain your data

-  What rights you have over your data

-  Where we send your data

-  Your contact information

-  How we protect your data

-  What data breach procedures we have in place

-  What third parties we receive data from

-  What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data

-  Any industry regulatory disclosure requirements

While not all of these questions will be applicable to all plugins, we
recommend taking care with the sections on data sharing.

Code Example
------------

--------------

      **Note:** It is recommended to call
      wp\ *add*\ privacy\ *policy*\ content during the admin_init
      action. Calling it outside of an action hook can lead to problems,
      see ticket #44142 for details.

.. code:: php

   function my_example_plugin_add_privacy_policy_content() {
       if ( ! function_exists( 'wp_add_privacy_policy_content' ) ) {
           return;
       }
    
       $content = sprintf(
           __( 'When you leave a comment on this site, we send your name, email
           address, IP address and comment text to example.com. Example.com does
           not retain your personal data.
    
           The example.com privacy policy is <a href="%s" target="_blank">here</a>.',
           'my_plugin_textdomain' ),
