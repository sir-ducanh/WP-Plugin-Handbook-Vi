- Receive feedback and reviews from users
- Provide support via a free forum

If you require assistance with your hosting on WordPress.org, you can contact the plugin team via Slack in `#pluginreview`.

## Requirements 

A brief overview:

- The provided [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) repository must be used for functional WordPress plugins only.
- Links such as a “powered by” link, or advertising, or external service calls are prohibited unless it is clearly documented and explicit user permission is granted.
- The plugin and developer must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive. This includes spamming or harassment.

> **Alert:** All plugins and developers must comply with our [Detailed Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/).
