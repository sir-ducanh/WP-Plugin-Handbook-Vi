# Plugin Security

[toc]

Congratulations, your code works! But is it safe? How will the plugin protect your users if their site gets hacked? The best plugins in the WordPress.org directory keep their users’ information safe.

Please keep in mind that your code may be running across hundreds, perhaps even millions, of websites, so security is of the utmost importance.

In this chapter we will cover how to [check user capabilities](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/checking-user-capabilities/), [validate](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/data-validation/) and [sanitize input](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/securing-input/), [sanitize output](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/securing-output/) and [create and validate nonces](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/nonces/).
